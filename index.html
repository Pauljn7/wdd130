    <h1>Welcome to My Page</h1>
    <p>Hi, my name is Paul Uagbale. This is my homepage for the WDD 130 class. 
       I’ll be posting my projects here as I work through the course. 
       I’m still learning HTML so this page will probably change as I go along.</p>

    <p>Some things about me: I enjoy learning new things, especially tech-related stuff. 
       I’m also looking forward to practicing more coding and getting better at web development.</p>
